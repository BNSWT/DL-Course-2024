## Homework 11: Single-cell RNA-Seq Visualization (Optional)

This assignment is optional (as an example of the final project). We will offer a bonus if you can complete this work.
* Prepare the environment and download the dataset to `./data`. Unzip the dataset.
* To analyze the advantages and disadvantages of results in Euclidean and hyperbolic space.
* To compare the hyperbolic method with the Euclidean method, including PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.
* Write a tech report of implementation and experiment results in pdf.

This implementation and results are based on EVNet.
